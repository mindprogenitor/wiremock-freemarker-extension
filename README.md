# wiremock-freemarker-extension

Wiremock Freemarker Extension is a [Wiremock](https://www.wiremock.org) extension that allows the use of the [Freemarker](https://freemarker.apache.org) template engine by using the stub body as a freemarker template and making the request available to be used in the template as variables (if the request is either a valid xml or json object, it will be parsed and the values may be referenced directly in the template).
